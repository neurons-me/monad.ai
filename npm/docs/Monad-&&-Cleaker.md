# monad.ai, Cleaker, and Public Roots
This page fixes a common confusion in the stack:
- `.me` is the semantic kernel
- `monad.ai` is the daemon
- `cleaker` is the binder that projects a `.me` into a namespace
- `cleaker.me` is the canonical public root
These are related, but they are not the same thing.

---

## Core Roles
### `.me`
`.me` is the local sovereign kernel.

It owns:
- identity derivation from seed
- keys and secret scopes
- semantic tree and memory log
- snapshots, hydration, replay
- cryptographic proof of identity

Examples:
- `me://self:read/profile`
- `me://self:write/profile.name`
- `me://self:explain/profile.netWorth`

### `monad.ai`
`monad.ai` is the daemon that runs a `.me` kernel and exposes it over the network.
It owns:
- serving namespace requests over HTTP
- resolving namespaces from the `Host` header
- persisting the kernel state via DiskStore
- handling claim/open lifecycle
- transport and routing

A `monad.ai` can run only for you on localhost, or it can be exposed publicly on a domain.
The kernel is the storage. There is no separate database.

### `cleaker`
`cleaker` is the binder.
It takes a `.me` instance and projects it into a namespace context. It handles the full bind lifecycle automatically:
1. Ask `.me` to prove identity
2. Attempt to open the namespace
3. If the namespace does not exist yet, claim it
4. Reopen and hydrate the kernel with the returned memories

```ts
const node = cleaker(me, {
  secret,
  namespace: 'username.cleaker.me',
  origin: 'https://cleaker.me',
})

await node.ready
```

`cleaker` does not store anything. It does not own the identity. It connects `.me` to a namespace and hands control back.

### `cleaker.me`
`cleaker.me` is not a different protocol.
It is a **public domain** running a `monad.ai` that acts as a canonical public root — a common agreement where identities can be anchored publicly.
That means:
- infrastructure-wise, it is a public `monad.ai`
- semantically, it is a well-known root for public namespaces like `jabellae.cleaker.me`
Any domain running a `monad.ai` can play this role. `cleaker.me` is the default, not the only option.

## Deployment Roles
### Local-only monad
A local-only monad runs `monad.ai` only for you — on your laptop, your home server, your LAN. It does not need to be publicly accessible.

```
http://suis-macbook-air.local:8161/
```

You get the full kernel, the full memory log, the full identity — just not exposed to the internet.

### Application domain
An application domain — like `otherNamespace.com`  — can run its own  `monad.ai` and use it as the namespace root for its users.
Users anchor their identity there:

```
username.othernamespace.com
```

The app does not need to use `cleaker.me`. It is its own notary.

### Public root
A public root is a domain that exposes namespace behavior publicly and lets anyone anchor an identity under it.
Examples:
- `cleaker.me` — the canonical public root
- any other domain running a public `monad.ai`

---

## Canonical Address vs Web Projection
`me://` is the canonical semantic address.
`https://` is one possible public projection of that address.

```
me://username.cleaker.me:read/profile
https://username.cleaker.me/profile
```

```
me://username.othernamespace.com:read/profile
https://username.othernamespace.com/profile
```

The semantic target is primary. The web URL is a projection chosen by the host.

---

## Key Spaces and Privacy
Topology does not imply publicity.
A space can be replicated to multiple surfaces — laptop, iPhone, home server — and still remain completely private. The distinction is:
- **topology** decides where the ciphertext exists
- **audience** decides who can open it
So a key space may live on many surfaces and still remain private if its audience is cryptographically closed.

```
T = {laptop, iphone, home-server}   ← surfaces where it lives
A = {jabellae}                       ← who can read it
```

---

## One-line Model
- `.me` holds the identity and the tree
- `cleaker` binds `.me` to a namespace
- `monad.ai` serves that namespace over the network
- `cleaker.me` is one public root among many possible ones

---

## Rule
- Every app can use `.me`
- Not every app needs `cleaker`
- Every public root can run `monad.ai`
- `cleaker.me` is the canonical default, not the only option
